# Aegis-V2X

**Calibrated Trust-Driven Joint Adaptive Control for Context-Aware, Resource-Efficient Digital Twin-Assisted V2X Communication**

A Trust-Aware Digital Twin Framework for Intelligent Prediction, Synchronization, Beam Management, and Adaptive Communication in Next-Generation 6G V2X Networks.

B.Tech Research Project — Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science, Chennai. Target venue: **IEEE PerCom 2027**.

## Project Status

**Current Phase: 1 — Research & Architecture** (owner: Vaishnavi)

See `docs/module_decomposition.md` for the full phase → folder → owner map.

## Core Idea

Every communication decision (prediction triggering, prediction horizon,
Digital Twin synchronization, beam adaptation, communication mode) is
governed by **TwinTrust-AP**: a unified policy driven by a *calibrated*
Digital Twin trust probability `T ∈ [0,1]` and a context-aware
criticality score `C ∈ [0,1]`, rather than fixed thresholds or
independently optimized heuristics.

```
Physical Env (CARLA) → Wireless Env (Sionna RT) → Multimodal Sync
  → Perception (PointPillars → V2X-ViT → GRU) → Digital Twin State
  → Trust Estimator + Criticality Estimator
  → TwinTrust-AP (TAHS + FSDP) → Execution → Feedback (closed loop)
```

## Getting Started (Phase 1)

```bash
bash scripts/setup_env.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
make test
```

Phase-specific stacks are installed only when that phase begins:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/simulation.txt   # Phase 2 (Haridharani)
pip install -r requirements/backend.txt      # Phase 3 (Logapriya)
pip install -r requirements/ai.txt           # Phase 4-5 (Vaishnavi)
pip install -r requirements/deployment.txt   # Phase 6 (Khushi)
```

## Mathematical Foundation

Trust, criticality, TAHS, and FSDP are formally defined in the project's
`03_Mathematical_Formulation` document and mirrored in
`configs/model.yaml` and the interfaces under `ai/` and `digital_twin/`.
Key invariants (boundedness, monotonicity, determinism) are enforced via
unit tests introduced in Phase 4-5.
